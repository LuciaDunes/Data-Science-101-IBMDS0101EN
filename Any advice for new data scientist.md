# Any Advice for New Data Scientist

**Be like a scientist!**
The shit that they is : 
- **EXTREMELY CURIOUS**
- **EXTREMELY ARGUMENTATIVE**
- **JUDGEMENTAL**
- **SHITTY AND BASTARDLY SMORT AND CREATIVE**
- **BE PARANOID AND BE BOLD**
- **GIVE INSIGHT LIKE TELLING STORIES TO CHILDREN AND DUMB MF**

It's not about analytical skills (even though is needed), but proficiency, expertise, and competitive advantage :D
