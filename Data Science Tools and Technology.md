# Data Science Tools and Technology

- Kitchen sink model ==> Input all of it, mess of shit, tara~
- Regression (Scatter method) ==> Draw the center line on the existing data
- ANN (Artificial Neural Network) ==> Search one by one so u know how the data goes
- Data Visualization ==> Data, image, tara~
- Nearest Neighbor ==> Data, closest or side by side classification, tara~
- Structured Data ==> Tabular data (Table, column, etc.)
- Unstructured Data ==> Text, video, image, etc.
- Machine Learning ==> Even though it's overrated, it's still good
- Regression (Sophisticated approach) ==> Mixed data influenced each other
